# Spark, Jetty, FreeMarker

Spark is minimal web framework.

Independent project.

Main Spark functionality is web server route configuration.
It uses embedded Jetty as web server 
and has support for multiple template engines.
On the other hand it does not have opinion on e.g. json handling.
I used GSON, but it could be anything.
