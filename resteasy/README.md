# RestEasy, Undertow, Freemarker

RestEasy is JAX-RS implementation.

It is sponsored by Red Hat
and used in WildFly Application Server.

RestEasy supports embedded Undertow web server and Jackson JAXB library.
Feeling I get from it is that you are supposed to use it as part of WebFly / Jboss AS.

No build in templating support or other fancy features.
Just the basics.
